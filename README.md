# Welcome to My GitHub Website!

## Introduction

This README will provide a brief overview of how HTML and CSS are used to create and style the website.

## HTML: The Structure

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of any webpage. It's used to structure content on the web. Here's what you typically find in an HTML document:

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- **`<html>`**: The root element of an HTML page.
- **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the webpage, like its title and links to CSS files.
- **`<body>`**: Houses the content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, and more.

In the repository, the `index.html` file is where the HTML structure of the website is defined.

## CSS: The Styling

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used for styling the HTML content. It allows you to set the visual aspects of your web page, including layout, colors, and fonts. Here's how CSS is linked to HTML:

- **Linking CSS to HTML**: In the `<head>` section of your HTML file, you can link to a CSS file using the `<link>` tag, which looks like this:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="static/styles.css">
